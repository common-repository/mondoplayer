+ Bloggers - Keep a consistent posting schedule
+ Digital Marketing Professionals - Grow your audience with the latest video content
+ Social Media Marketers - Drive followers to your site with compelling content

Video is the most popular content on the web. Visitors will spend more time on your site exploring videos you curate and post with MondoPlayer.

Search engines will rank your site higher if it has a steady supply of relevant video.

With MondoPlayer you'll never be too busy to post great video to your WordPress blog.

Over 70% of video available on the web is not on YouTube. Most publishers keep their best video on their own site, where conventional curation tools can’t find it.

MondoPlayer finds the latest videos from more sources than any other content curation tool.

You’ll attract your target market and increase traffic to your content and calls to action.
